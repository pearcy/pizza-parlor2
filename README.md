## Description

A webpage that will allow user to select a pizza size & toppings a total price will be returned. 


## Specs

Create a web application that takes a a pizza order (size, topping) and returns the total cost of the pizza. 

1. **Behavior:** The application stores the inputs for size and toppings.
    * **Input Example:** User Selects "size" with an option to add "toppings"
    * **Output Example:** size: "", toppings: [], 

2. **Behavior:** If a user selects toppings it calculates a topping price based on the number of toppings.
    * **Input Example:** Checks the topping selection check boxes
    * **Output Example:** generates a topping price that is stored as a variable

3. **Behavior:** The application will calculate the total cost of the pizza based on the size & toppings. 
    * **Input Example:** size: 10", toppings: cheese, pepperoni
    * **Output Example:** $16.00


Add two more specs;
    
    The program first stores the input of size which has a price value, then if a user selects toppings it loops through the selections to generate a topping price, 
    
    after that would come the spec that takes the user inputs and shows the user their total.
